   The correct output given the input [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], 5
   is [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]. The reason for this is in how the
   two programs "move" along the existing array from left
   to right, replacing certain values along the way. First,
   the first two indicies of the array are flipped, and then
   the first value is set to 1. Then, this happens again, but
   this time the first and third values in the array are
   flipped, moving 3 to the first position and then overwriting
   it with 1. As this pattern continues and eventually gets to 
   the end, all five of the values in the array are eventually
   set to 1, creating the final array of [1, 1, 1, 1, 1].
