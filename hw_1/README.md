The answers to parts one, two, and four are within the document
titled hw1.txt

My code for question 5 is contained within palindrome.cpp
It may be compiled using the following:
g++ -g -Wall palindrome.cpp -o palindrome
and executed using the following:
./palindrome racecar
(where racecar can be substituted with any user input)


My code for question 6 is contained within hw1q6.cpp
It may be compiled using the following:
g++ -g -Wall hw1q6.cpp -o hw1q6
and executed using the following:
./hw1q6 test.txt
(where test.txt is any text file with the first line containing
an integer signifying the number of words in the file, and the
words in the file to be reversed by the program)


My code for question 7 is contained within skyline.cpp
It may be compiled using the following:
g++ -g -Wall skyline.cpp -o skyline
and executed using the following:
./skyline input.txt output.txt
(where input and output are the text files for the skyline
commands and the outputs, respectively)
